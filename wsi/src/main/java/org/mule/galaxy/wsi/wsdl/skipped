These are rules I've skipped for now.

R2001  A DESCRIPTION MUST only use the WSDL "import" statement to import another WSDL description.
R2002  To import XML Schema Definitions, a DESCRIPTION MUST use the XML Schema "import" statement.

Will be caught by R2028:
R2003 A DESCRIPTION MUST use the XML Schema "import" statement only within the xsd:schema element of the types section. 

R2009  An XML Schema directly or indirectly imported by a DESCRIPTION MAY include the Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM).

R2010 An XML Schema directly or indirectly imported by a DESCRIPTION MUST use either UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoding.

R2011 An XML Schema directly or indirectly imported by a DESCRIPTION MUST use version 1.0 of the eXtensible Markup Language W3C Recommendation.

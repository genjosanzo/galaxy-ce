The scripts in this directory are used internally and should not be run directly 
by the user.

Note that Mule only bundles precompiled binaries from the tanuki java service 
wrapper project. If you're missing the wrapper binaries for your platform, go to

  http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/doc/english/introduction.html

download the precompiled binaries for your platform and place them in this 
directory. You may have to make modifications to the "mule" script in the
bin folder, too.
